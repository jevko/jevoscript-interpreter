# Jezyk

Interpreter for Jezyk aka [JevoScript](https://codeberg.org/jevko-org/JevoScript) which implements tail call optimization.

Syntax is based on [Jevko](https://jevko.org). It's Jevko minus digraphs plus a version of [multistrings](https://djedr.github.io/posts/multistrings-2023-05-25.html).

## Why?

To experiment with Uniform Call Syntax, tail call optimization, Jevko variants, and other programming language design and implementation ideas.
